# Tiger CoWork v1.3.0

A self-hosted AI workspace with chat, code execution, parallel multi-agent orchestration, cross-machine agent connection, and a skill marketplace. Mix different AI providers in the same agent team — OpenAI-compatible APIs, Claude Code CLI, and Codex CLI. Connect agents across machines on your network so distributed teams can collaborate in real time. Connect external MCP servers to extend the AI's toolbox. Built with 16 built-in tools and designed for long-running sessions with smart context compression and checkpoint recovery.

## What's New in v1.3.0

- **Live Agent Diagram** — real-time interactive graph showing orchestrator and worker agents with live status badges (Active/Waiting/Done), current tool calls, connection edge states (idle/working/awaiting result), and Bus protocol activity bar. Zoom, pan, and fullscreen controls for large agent teams.
- **Task & Remote Task Logs** — unified chat log panel streams timestamped tool calls, agent thinking/reasoning, and inter-agent delegation events. Pause/resume scrolling and view logs per session.
- **System Messages for Remote Tasks** — remote task delegation now includes system-level status messages showing remote agent progress, heartbeat, and completion across machines.
- **Async Parallel Sub-Agent Algorithm** — agents work in true parallel using async task dispatching; the orchestrator delegates via `send_task` and awaits results concurrently with `wait_result`, enabling all workers to execute simultaneously.
- **New P2P Algorithm** — improved peer-to-peer swarm with Contract Net Protocol bidding on the Blackboard, confidence-domain routing, and reputation-scored agent selection for decentralized task allocation.
- **Per-Project Agent Mode Override** — each project can override the global sub-agent mode (Auto Spawn, Auto Create, Manual, Realtime, Auto Swarm) and pick its own YAML config, architecture type, agent count, and connection protocols.
- **Auto Architecture — AI-Decided Settings** — new "Auto (AI decides)" option for architecture type and agent count (3-8 default). Connection protocols are now multi-select toggle buttons.
- **Full Chat Log with Agent Reasoning** — every chat session records a complete log capturing user messages, tool calls, sub-agent reasoning, and final responses.
- **Finished Tasks History** — Tasks page shows the last 100 completed/cancelled/errored tasks with status, duration, agents used, and tools called.

> **Warning:** This app executes AI-generated code and shell commands. Run it inside Docker or a sandboxed environment. See [Security & Docker Setup](docs/TECHNICAL.md#security-notice).

## Benchmark

![FrontierScience-Olympiad Benchmark](picture/benchmark_frontier_science.png)

**FrontierScience-Olympiad accuracy** — Minimax 2.7 as a single agent scores 62%. With TigrimOS multi-agent orchestration, the same model reaches **75%**, surpassing Claude Opus 4.5 (71.4%) and Grok 4 (66.2%), and approaching Gemini 3 Pro (76.1%) and GPT-5.2 (77.1%).

## Key Features

- **AI Chat with 16 Built-in Tools** — web search, Python, React, shell, files, skills, sub-agents
- **Mix Any Model per Agent** — assign different AI providers per agent (API, Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI)
- **Parallel Multi-Agent System** — 7 orchestration topologies, 4 communication protocols, P2P swarm governance
- **Cross-Machine Agent Connection** — connect agents running on different machines over the network, enabling distributed multi-agent collaboration across your infrastructure
- **Minecraft Task Monitor** — live pixel-art characters (Steve, Creeper, Enderman, etc.) with speech bubbles showing agent activity, walking animations when agents interact
- **Long-Running Session Stability** — sliding window compression, smart tool result handling, checkpoint recovery
- **MCP Integration** — connect any Model Context Protocol server (Stdio, SSE, StreamableHTTP)
- **Output Panel** — renders React components, charts, HTML, PDF, Word, Excel, images, and Markdown
- **Skills & ClawHub** — install AI skills from the marketplace or build your own
- **Projects** — dedicated workspaces with memory, skill selection, and file browser

## Installation

### One-Click Installers

**Mac:**
1. Download [`TigerCoWork.zip`](https://github.com/Sompote/tiger_cowork/releases/latest)
2. Unzip, right-click `TigerCoWork.app` and select **Open**

**Windows:**
1. Download [`TigerCoWorkInstaller.zip`](https://github.com/Sompote/tiger_cowork/releases/latest)
2. Unzip and run `TigerCoWorkInstaller.bat`

**Prerequisite:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) must be installed and running.

| | Mac | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| **Start** | Double-click `TigerCoWork.app` | Double-click `TigerCoWorkStart.bat` |
| **Stop** | Docker Desktop → Containers → Stop | Double-click `TigerCoWorkStop.bat` |

### Terminal Install

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sompote/tiger_cowork/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sompote/tiger_cowork/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Manual Install

Log in to your Linux server directly or via SSH:
```bash
ssh root@<your-server-ip>
```

> **⚠️ Security Warning:** AI agents can execute arbitrary code and shell commands that may modify or delete files on the host system. It is strongly recommended to run Tiger CoWork on a **VPS or dedicated machine that contains no important data**. Do not run it on a machine with sensitive or irreplaceable information.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js >= 18, npm, Python 3 (optional)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sompote/tiger_cowork.git
cd tiger_cowork
bash setup.sh        # installs deps, prompts for ClawHub token
npm run build && npm start   # → http://localhost:3001
```

> **Running in background (recommended):** Use [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to keep Tiger CoWork running after you close the terminal.
>
> ```bash
> npm install -g pm2          # install PM2 globally
> npm run build               # build production bundle
> pm2 start npm --name "tiger-cowork" -- start   # start in background
> pm2 save                    # save process list for auto-restart
> pm2 startup                 # enable auto-start on system boot
> ```
>
> Useful PM2 commands:
> ```bash
> pm2 status                  # check running processes
> pm2 logs tiger-cowork       # view logs
> pm2 restart tiger-cowork    # restart
> pm2 stop tiger-cowork       # stop
> ```

> **First-time token:** The default token is `your-secret-token-here` in the UI. Please change it later in `.env` for your security.

## Quick Start

1. Open `http://localhost:3001`
2. Go to **Settings** → enter your API Key, API URL, and Model
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify
