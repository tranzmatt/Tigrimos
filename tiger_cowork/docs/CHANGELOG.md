# Changelog

## v1.3.1 (2026-04-18)
**Fix Custom Skill Python Execution, Output Panel Stability, VM Settings Persistence**

- **Fix custom skill Python execution** — skills with supporting Python scripts now execute correctly in the VM; fixed `sandboxDir` and `pythonPath` resolution so `run_python` no longer returns empty results when called from skill workflows
- **Fix output panel constant reloading** — React charts, images, and iframes in the output panel no longer re-render every 2-3 seconds; stabilized with `React.memo` deep comparison, global component cache, and removed URL cache-busting
- **Fix agent empty tool results** — when `run_python` returns empty stdout, errors and warnings from stderr are now promoted to stdout so the agent sees failures instead of fabricating answers
- **Python error visibility** — user code is wrapped in try/except so uncaught exceptions always appear in stdout with full traceback
- **VM settings persistence** — `sandboxDir` and `pythonPath` in `settings.json` are now auto-corrected before every service start via systemd `ExecStartPre`, surviving VM restarts
- **Project path migration** — old absolute paths in `projects.json` (e.g. `/root/cowork/...`) are automatically migrated to relative paths during VM provisioning
- **Terminal lands in /app** — VM terminal now opens in the application directory instead of `/root`

## v1.3.0 (2026-04-15)
**Live Agent Diagram, Async Parallel Sub-Agents, New P2P Algorithm, Terminal Access**

- **Live Agent Diagram** — real-time interactive graph showing orchestrator and worker agents with live status badges (Active/Waiting/Done), current tool calls, connection edge states, and Bus protocol activity bar
- **Task & Remote Task Logs** — unified chat log panel streams timestamped tool calls, agent reasoning, and inter-agent delegation events
- **Async Parallel Sub-Agent Algorithm** — agents work in true parallel using async task dispatching; orchestrator delegates via `send_task` and awaits results concurrently with `wait_result`
- **New P2P Algorithm** — improved peer-to-peer swarm with Contract Net Protocol bidding, confidence-domain routing, and reputation-scored agent selection
- **Benchmark suite** — performance benchmarks for agent orchestration
- **Terminal access** — new Terminal tab in sidebar navigation, macOS toolbar button, and Windows batch launcher
- **Fix macOS Tahoe VM boot** — VirtioFS directory sharing validation now fails gracefully; if the OS rejects shared folders the VM boots without them and provision.sh falls back to git-clone

## v1.2.1 (2026-04-12)
**Per-Project Agent Overrides, Chat Logs, Finished Tasks**

- **Per-Project Agent Mode Override** — each project can override the global sub-agent mode and pick its own YAML config, architecture type, agent count, and connection protocols
- **Auto Architecture — AI-Decided Settings** — new "Auto (AI decides)" option for architecture type and agent count
- **Full Chat Log with Agent Reasoning** — every chat session records a complete log capturing user messages, tool calls, sub-agent reasoning, and final responses
- **Finished Tasks History** — Tasks page shows the last 100 completed/cancelled/errored tasks with status, duration, agents used, and tools called

## v1.2.0 (2026-04-11)
**Kimi Provider, VM Improvements**

- **Kimi as built-in AI provider** — Kimi (Moonshot AI) added as a default provider in Settings
- **Simplified VM disk attachment** — use `VZDiskImageStorageDeviceAttachment` for raw disk files instead of block device, fixing compatibility across macOS versions

## v1.1.1 (2026-04-08)
**Soul & Identity, Chat Fixes**

- **Soul & Identity persona system** — new collapsible section in Settings to define SOUL.md (internal cognition, values, behavior ~3,000 chars) and IDENTITY.md (external presentation, name, tone ~200 chars). Both are injected into the orchestrator's system prompt when answering humans. Leave empty for default personality.
- **Thinking filter** — server-side paragraph-level filter strips model chain-of-thought leakage (e.g. "The user is asking...", "I should respond...") when soul/identity persona is active
- **Fix duplicate chat responses** — removed redundant `chat:chunk` that sent the full response content alongside `chat:response`, causing the same message to appear twice
- **Fix output panel reload** — React visualizations and iframes no longer remount on every chat response; uses stable file-list key instead of incrementing counter
- **Fix conversational nudge** — simple chat replies without tool calls no longer get incorrectly nudged to "keep working", which caused extra reasoning text and duplicate responses
- **Fix stream buffer leak** — cleared pending stream buffer and flush timer on response to prevent stale streaming content from reappearing

## v1.1.0 (2026-04-06)
**Remote Agent Swarm**

- **Cross-machine remote agents** — TigrimOS instances can delegate tasks to each other over the network; fully peer-to-peer (any machine can be orchestrator or worker)
- **Persona & Responsibility matching** — orchestrator auto-selects the right remote agent based on expertise and task match
- **Live remote progress** — remote agent activity appears in the Minecraft Task Monitor with speech bubbles
- **Configurable remote timeouts** — poll interval, idle timeout, and max timeout in Settings
- **Swarm communication protocols** — TCP (private 1-on-1), Bus (broadcast), Blackboard (P2P auction), Mesh (any-to-any)
- **Three agent modes** — Spawn Agent (one-shot YAML), Live Session (persistent with protocol tools), Direct Remote (AI picks instance)
- **AgentEditor** — shows persona/responsibility fields for remote agents
- **New tiger logo app icon**
- Added `duckduckgo-search` and `requests` to VM provisioning
- Sub-agent timeout default: 120s → 300s
- Remote idle timeout default: 60s → 120s
- Stale task cleanup now configurable and disabled by default

## v1.0.0 (2026-04-03)
**First Desktop Release**

- **macOS native app** — TigrimOS.app (Apple Silicon) and TigrimOS_i.app (Intel) via Apple Virtualization.framework
- **Windows installer** — TigrimOSInstaller.bat with WSL2-based Ubuntu sandbox
- **Secure Ubuntu sandbox** — host files invisible by default, opt-in shared folders
- **Minecraft Task Monitor** — live pixel-art agents with speech bubbles and walking animations
- **16 built-in tools** — web search, Python, React, shell, files, skills, sub-agents
- **Skill marketplace (ClawHub)** — install and manage AI skills
- **MCP integration** — connect any Model Context Protocol server

## v0.4.2
**MiniMax Built-in Provider**

- **MiniMax as built-in AI provider** — MiniMax is now available as a default provider in the Settings dropdown (URL: api.minimax.io/v1, Model: MiniMax-M2.7). No need to manually add it as a custom provider.

## v0.4.1
**Per-Agent Model Selection & CLI Agent Backends**

- **Per-agent model & provider selection** — Each agent in your architecture can run on a different model or backend. In the Agent Editor, check "Specify model for this agent" and pick any model — API-based or local CLI.
- **Claude Code & Codex as code agents (OAuth)** — Set any agent to "Claude Code (Local CLI)" or "Codex (Local CLI)". These run as fully autonomous coding agents with their own tool loops. No API key needed — they authenticate via OAuth.
- **Agent waiting/done states** — Task monitor now shows running, waiting, and done agents with distinct visual states and icons.
- **Anti-abandonment nudges** — Prevents the LLM from stopping while sub-agents are still working or when responses sound incomplete.
- **Python auto-retry** — Automatically fixes common syntax errors and retries.
- **Max context tokens setting** — Configure the token threshold for auto-compaction in Settings.

## v0.4.0 (2026-03-30)
**Major release: Full Parallel Agent Execution**

- **Parallel agent execution** — `wait_result` added to `parallelToolNames` so multiple agent results are awaited simultaneously via `Promise.all` instead of sequentially. Agents that previously appeared to run one-at-a-time now truly work in parallel.
- **Per-task context isolation** — Replaced global `_currentParentSessionId`/`_currentAgentId`/`_currentSubagentDepth`/`_currentProjectWorkingFolder` with a `Map<string, CallContext>` keyed by taskId. `callTool()` accepts optional `taskId` to read from the correct context. Concurrent tasks no longer corrupt each other's state.
- **Parallel task UI** — Removed `isLoading` send-blocking guard from ChatPage. Users can now send multiple messages while agents are working. Input, textarea, and attach button remain enabled during task execution. Status bar shows running task count.
- **Direct orchestrator bypass** — When realtime mode is active and the YAML config has an orchestrator role agent, user messages are published directly to the orchestrator via bus, skipping the main LLM `callTigerBotWithTools` call entirely. Falls back to normal flow on timeout. Saves one full LLM API call per user message.
- **Live task monitor redesign** — 8-color agent palette with stable hash-based assignment. Active agents shown as colored pills with animated pulsing dots. Agent tool rows have colored left borders, background highlights when active, play/checkmark status icons, and per-agent tool call counts. Polling reduced from 5s to 2s with socket-driven instant refresh on tool calls and agent events.
- **Multi-agent tracking** — `activeAgent` (single string) replaced with `activeAgents` (Set) on the server. Multiple agents working simultaneously are now properly tracked and displayed. Finished agents are removed from the active set instead of resetting to "Orchestrator".
- **Task-to-chat navigation** — Task page cards now include a "Chat" button that navigates to `/?session=<id>`. ChatPage reads `?session=` query param to auto-select the corresponding chat session.
- **`callTigerBotWithTools` taskId parameter** — New optional `taskId` parameter threaded through `callTigerBotWithTools` → `callTool` for per-task context resolution. Both `chat:send` and `project:chat:send` handlers pass taskId and call `clearCallContext(taskId)` in finally blocks.

## v0.3.2 (2026-03-23)
- Add **per-agent Mesh checkbox** — individual agents can be marked as "mesh enabled" to freely send tasks to any other agent without needing connection lines, similar to the Bus checkbox for broadcast data sharing
- Add **Hybrid architecture mode** — combines an orchestrator (controls flow via TCP connections) with mesh-enabled workers (collaborate freely as peers); orchestrator auto-receives bus tools to monitor all agent activity and prevent infinite loops
- Add **config file name display** in chat header — shows the active YAML architecture file name next to the Realtime Agent / Swarm tag
- Change connection line protocols to **TCP and Queue only** — removed Bus as a connection protocol since bus access is controlled per-agent via the Bus checkbox, not via connection lines
- Change **Mesh from global mode to per-agent** — instead of a global orchestration mode, each agent individually opts into mesh via checkbox; global Mesh mode still available for all-agents-free-talk scenarios
- Add per-agent mesh access control: mesh-enabled agents bypass connection validation in `send_task`; non-mesh agents must use explicit connections
- Add mesh-aware tool assignment: mesh agents receive `send_task`/`wait_result` tools with full peer list even without explicit downstream connections
- Add `mesh` field to `AgentConfig` interface and YAML schema (`mesh: { enabled: true }`)
- Update auto-architecture LLM prompt with connection policy (TCP/Queue only), bus policy (checkbox only), mesh policy (per-agent), and hybrid architecture rules
- Fix **agent config delete** not working — Fastify 5 rejected DELETE requests with empty JSON body; now only sets `Content-Type: application/json` when request has a body

## v0.3.1 (2026-03-22)
- Add **Human Node** role — new "human" agent role that acts as the user's entry point in realtime agent graphs without running an LLM loop
- Add **`/agent` command** for direct agent communication: `/agent [name] "prompt"` (targeted) or `/agent "prompt"` (broadcast to all connected agents)
- Add **human-to-agent and agent-to-human messaging** — human node loop listens for agent outputs and forwards to chat UI with attribution tags
- Add human node UI in Agent Editor — dedicated styling, info panel, hidden AI-setup and model fields for human role
- Add `getHumanConnectedAgents`, `humanSendToAgent`, `humanBroadcastToAgents`, `humanWaitForAgent` helpers in toolbox service
- Add drawing-analyzer v2.1.0 to ClawHub plugin registry

## v0.3.0 (2026-03-21)
