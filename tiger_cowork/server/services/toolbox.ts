- For flat: human connects to all agents directly
- For mesh: do NOT generate connections — mesh mode bypasses access control
- For hybrid: human → orchestrator, workers have mesh.enabled: true
- For pipeline: agents form a sequential chain
- For p2p: ALL non-human agents use role "peer", no connections, use blackboard
- Each non-human agent must have a meaningful persona and 3-5 responsibilities
- Agent IDs must be snake_case
- Connections must use "${protocol}" protocol
- Every non-human agent MUST have at least one incoming connection
